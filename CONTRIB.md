# Get Started
Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both:
 To report security vulnerabilities, please use our Responsible Disclosure Program which is monitored by our security team.
 Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
 
# Issues
Issues should be used to report problems with the library, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created. 
When you create a new Issue, a template will be loaded that will guide you through collecting and providing the information we need to investigate.
If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. 
Adding a reaction can also help be indicating to our maintainers that a particular problem is affecting more than just the reporter.
